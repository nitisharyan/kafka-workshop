# Kafka Lab 2 - Generate a Console consumer to print statistics on Cpu and Memory usage

In this lab you will implement a simple console-based consumer that will consume messages from the **“cpuMetrics”** topic, and print out statistics about consumed messages.
When consuming the messages in Kafka, you must use a unique consumer group identifier (use your full name). This will ensure that you receive all data from the Kafka cluster, and not share them with another member of the class.
In order to complete this lab.
